## Introduction

This work is inspired by a series of problems I encountered when I was a fresh man in my University. 

In every when September when fresh men stream into the University, they are so confused by all the complicated registration process---register, submit photos, get and charge the student card, apply for the Internet access account, figure out where to live and what to eat, catch the school bus...

They have to swallow all kinds of information in their first few weeks as fresh men, help from the school and others is neither sufficient nor handy. So it comes to my mind: 

__Why not put all the necessary information on one single platform?__
